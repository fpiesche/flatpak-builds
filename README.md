# Random Flatpak builds

This is a repository holding some Flatpak builds I've assembled which can't be submitted to Flathub for a variety of reasons - the developers have gone missing or retired so I can't get approval for a submission, or the licensing situation is unclear or incompatible with Flathub, or the developers have specifically said they don't want their app to be listed on Flathub.
