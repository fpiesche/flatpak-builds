  <description>
    Along with support for Classic Marathon Infinity on Steam and an uploader for the Steam Workshop, this release also includes a new scenario chooser.

    To use the scenario chooser, place the Aleph One executable in a folder containing scenario folders, or add a "Scenarios" folder to one of the original trilogy folders. The scenario chooser is not included with all-in-one Mac apps; use the standalone Aleph One app instead.
